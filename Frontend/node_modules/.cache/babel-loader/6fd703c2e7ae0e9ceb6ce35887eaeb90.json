These Images can now be directly sent across to the Runner via email at a certain cost for each photograph.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 14,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 10,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 9,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 7,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this);\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default About;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/ajay/Desktop/Project2/BibSense/frontendFolder/src/components/About/About.js"],"names":["React","Component","Background","About","render"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,cAAvB;;;AAEA,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBF,SAApB,CAA8B;AAC5BG,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,wBACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAG,kBAAjB;AAAA,6BAEE;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,2BAAf;AAAA,+BACE;AAAK,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA,kCACE;AAAG,YAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAb;AAAyB,YAAA,KAAK,EAAC,OAA/B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADF,eAIE;AAAG,YAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAJF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADF;AAoBD;;AAtB2B;;AAwB9B,eAAeD,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Background from \"./Background\";\n\nclass About extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className = \"container-fluid2\"> \n         \n        <div className=\"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid\">\n          <div className=\"container\">\n            <h className=\"display-2\" color=\"black\">\n                About\n                </h>\n            <p className=\"lead\">Introduction to the problem statement\n\nWhile many underestimate what it takes to get tagged photos into email inboxes, this team identifies this as a problem statement that can be translated into a viable solution for sport event photographers to generate E-commerce.
